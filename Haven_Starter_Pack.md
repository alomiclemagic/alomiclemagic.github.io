## 💔 A Message From Elena

My cousin jumped from her mother's balcony at 33, leaving behind her 3-year-old son.

Everyone called her crazy, sick, put her in hospitals, judged her, mocked her.

**But she wasn't crazy. She was DROWNING. And no one threw her a rope.**

In many ways, I became her. I walked through that same fire.

**But I found water. And now I'm throwing YOU a rope.**

This guide contains EVERYTHING that saved my life:
- Daily checklists
- Realistic schedules
- Income plans
- Self-care strategies
- Motivation for hard days

**You are not alone. You've got this.** 💪
